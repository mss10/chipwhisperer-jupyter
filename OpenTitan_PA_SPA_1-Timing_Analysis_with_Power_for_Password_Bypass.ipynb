This is performed along the length of the reference trace, $J$. Put simply, we're subtracting the two traces, taking the absolute value, then adding these absolute differences. If this value is low, the traces are very similar. If the value is high, they're very different. Our strategy will be as follows:\n",

Try to write this function yourself, but if you get stuck, `PA_SPA_1_answers.py` has a working version. For maximum compatability with the tutorial, make this function return `None` if it doesn't find a match."

One caveat here is that this technique will likely fail on the last password, since the part of the trace we're checking won't occur if we guess the password correctly. To work around this, we can simply check the response to see if we've got the whole password correct using `target.read()`. Again, if you're really stuck, a working guess function can be found in `PA_SPA_1_answers.py`"
