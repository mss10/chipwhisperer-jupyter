Your target may differ, but in my case, there were some distinct spikes of about -0.25 at 229 in red and 265 in blue. The plot is interactive, so you can zoom in and move around using the buttons on the right side of the plot. Record their locations, value, and the difference in location (in my case, 229, 265, -0.25, and 36). \n",

At the beginning the power traces are similar even though the number of characters correct is different. However, there is a point where they start to become significantly different. If you can find this spot you can use this spot to do the timing analysis instead. The difference in location should be the same as when using distinct peaks.\n",
